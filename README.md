In development:
	- Redo the monster structure by making a HostileNPC class that inherits from a parent NPC class, so we can make a FriendlyNPC class and then make quest givers, merchants etc...
	
	- Quest system (requires a new NPC structure)
	
	- Redo interface with images for spell bar, character frame (top left), xp bar.
	
	- Have a camera centered on the player and apply an offset to the entities in the zone so that when he moves, the entities move.
	
	- Have a spell book where spells are stored, so that the player can change them and modify his spell bar as he wishes.
